Read Simulink model file and get blocks and their properties

create and parse mdl file programatically
Hi,

I want to parse an mdl file to fetch the block data from and mdl file and store it in my application database. Similarly I have to create an mdl file from the data 
within my application to open in the matlab.
Are there any exposed C++/JAVA APIs from matlab-simulink to parse and/or create mdl file?
Or is there any other way (using S Functions) to do the same thing?

Thanks
Kaushal

I would like to create a structure in Python which represents a Simulink model. I am aware of at least two ways of doing this - by parsing an ".mdl" file, or by using Matlab's api for communicating with the model.
